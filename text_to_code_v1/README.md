# Text to Code

Everyone needs privacy!
Messages sent to other's devices can be read by anyone using his/her devices.
Messages sent to someone on a group can be readable by anyone in that group.
Many people can get your message but what if only people you choose can understand it.
This is possible if the message is encoded in a form that only you and people you 
choose can decode.
Using this text to code program, you can transform your message into code made up of emojis or symbols. That can be decoded only using this program.
