# Age Calculator

An HTML, JS, CSS program to calculate the age.
The UI is clean and minimal for easy use.
The background is bright white with pink for inputs and green and red for buttons.

There are two input fields:
    One for the current date that automatically fetches the current date and second one is for another date(probably birthdate).
    The clear button appears only when it is needed.

### Main features:
    * A happy birthday wish if Birthday is detected.
    * Doesn't perform calculation if the fields are left blank.
